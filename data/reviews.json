      "comment": "Before Sofia worked on my brows, they were my biggest insecurity. Now, I feel brand new and LOVE my brows! Sofia took her time to carefully map my brows to perfection and maintain my natural shape while filling in where I was missing hair. She made me so comfortable throughout the entire appointment and I experienced no pain. Sofia thoroughly explained the healing process to me and even sent me home with the cutest little aftercare goodie bag. Thank you for my new brows Sofia!!!",

Sofia is so professional and informed me of everything I needed to know and guided me through the healing process. It's one of the best choices I made this year. Looking forward to going in for Scalp micro pigmentation!",
